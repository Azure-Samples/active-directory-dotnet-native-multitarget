# Integrating Azure AD into a cross platform Xamarin application (archived)

**There's a newer version of this sample taking advantage of the Microsoft identity platform** (formerly Azure AD v2.0)

 Check it out: https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-xamarin-native-v2

 If you really need to access this Azure AD v1.0 sample, you can navigate to the [master](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-dotnet-native-multitarget/tree/master) branch, but please know that it's no longer supported.
